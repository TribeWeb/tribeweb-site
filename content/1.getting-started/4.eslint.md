title: ESLint
description: A recipe to set up ESLint in a Nuxt 3 project.
---

Beginning to use Nuxt is one thing but learning all the tooling that developers use is another challenge entirely. There have been many times that I have set out to experiment with a feature or idea only to find myself sabotaged by some quirk in my development environment. The issue that seems to catch me out more often than any other is prettifying and linting. It's frustrating and confusing to have your code default to messy and unformatted when it's supposed to resemble the examples being followed in the documentation.

So when I saw that the Nuxt team had consolidated all the various and historical linting strategies into one new module, I thought my troubles were over - and they were - eventually!

Here's what I learned - for anyone interested as well as for my future self (who will have forgotten the details by next week).

Special thanks to [@hacknug](https://github.com/hacknug) who thoroughly and patiently answered all my questions in nuxt/eslint issue #462

## 

You can just start writing `.md` or `.yml` files in the [`content/`](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/content-directory) directory to have your pages updated.
The navigation will be automatically generated in the left aside and in the mobile menu. You will also be able to go through your content with full-text search.

This template relies on a [catch-all route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#catch-all-route) but you can achieve the same thing with the [document-driven mode](https://content.nuxt.com/document-driven/introduction).

## App Configuration

In addition to `@nuxt/ui-pro` configuration through the `app.config.ts`, this template lets you customize the `Header`, `Footer` and the `Table of contents` components.

### Header

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  eslint: {
    config: {
      stylistic: true
    }
    // checker: {
    //   lintOnStart: true,
    //   fix: true,
    // },
  },
})
```

### Footer

```json [.vscode/settings.json]
{
  "eslint.useFlatConfig": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "always",
  },
}
```

### Table of contents

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  toc: {
    // Title of the main table of contents
    title: 'Table of Contents',
    // Bottom TOC configuration
    bottom: {
      // Title of the bottom table of contents
      title: 'Community',
      // URL of your repository content folder
      edit: '',
      // Customize links
      links: [{
        icon: 'i-heroicons-star',
        label: 'Star on GitHub',
        to: 'https://github.com/nuxt/ui',
        target: '_blank',
      }, {
        icon: 'i-heroicons-book-open',
        label: 'Nuxt UI Pro docs',
        to: 'https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/guide',
        target: '_blank',
      }, {
        icon: 'i-simple-icons-nuxtdotjs',
        label: 'Purchase a license',
        to: 'https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/purchase',
        target: '_blank',
      }]
    }
  }
})
```

A dedicated interface is provided to edit those configurations on Nuxt Studio.
